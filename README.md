I have created a clone of the netflix sign up page page as close as I could. Using only HTML and CSS. This is my first project using HTML and CSS. Thanks for stopping by!

Some bugs that need clarification:
1. Usage of radio in FAQ dropdown(deselecting not possible)
2. Not as dynamic and responsive to changes in window as original
3. Main page background mosaic gradient(Original uses 2 linear gradients that stop in the middle.(from top-to-mid and bottom-to-mid) (I have used Radial gradient; creates black to transparent gradient on both sides)

Thanks to assisstance from CodeWithHarry's Netflix Clone Tutorial(available on YouTube and GitHub repo).
